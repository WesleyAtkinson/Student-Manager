## Development

Two local development servers need starting in order to run this app.

### Backend

Inside the `backend` folder run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will create a local sqlite3 database for you.

### Frontend

Inside the `frontend` folder run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can access the frontend at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
